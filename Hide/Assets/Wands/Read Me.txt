Free 3D Wand Pack


To make use of the items pivot points look to the right of the four main control buttons (pan, move, rotate, scale), and you'll see two other buttons.

The first toggles between "Center" or "Pivot", and the second toggles between "Local" or "Global".

Use "Pivot" for the first one and "Local" for the second one.

25 Wands
25 Orbs
1 Texture 256x256 (same ones as the rest of the packs in this style)
Includes example scene with all the items.
